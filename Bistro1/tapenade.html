  <p> This is a really simply dish to prepare and it's always a big hit at
  parties. My father recommends: </p>

  <blackout>
  <p> <em>"Make this the night before so that the flavors have time to blend.
  just bring it up to room temperature before you serve it. In the winter, try
  serving it warm."</em> </p>
  </blackout>

  <h2> Ingredients </h2>
  <pre>
  1 8oz. jar sundried tomatoes
  2 large garlic cloves
  2/3 c. kalamata olives
  1 t. capers
  </pre>

  <h2> Instructions </h2>
  <p> Combine tomatoes and garlic in a food processor. Blend until as smooth
  as possible. </p>
  <p> Add capers and olives. Pulse the motor a few times until they are
  incorporated, but still remain some texture. </p> 
  <p> Serve on thin toast rounds with goat cheese and fresh basil garnish
  (optional). </p>
